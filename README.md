# ETS2_RadioFix

You can check current status of implementation here: [Stations status](STATIONS.md)

## About the project

This project aims to create a one stop repository containing updated internet radio station file for [Euro Track Simulator 2](https://eurotrucksimulator2.com/). Radio stations are based on community updated fandom article [Radio Stations ATS&ETS2](https://truck-simulator.fandom.com/wiki/Radio_Stations).

## Installation

1. Navigate to your ETS2/ATS documents folder (Usual path example: C:\Users\\[WIN_USERNAME]\Documents\Euro Truck Simulator 2)
2. Create a backup of your current radio stations file (*live_streams.sii*)
    * You can copy the file to an external folder
    * You can also rename the file for example (*live_streams.sii* :arrow_forward: *live_streams_BACKUP.sii*)
3. Replace the original file with the one downloaded from the project
